## Development
The application uses Expo, so you don't need to install an Android or iOS environment. Just install the Expo Go app on your phone.

### Running the application in development mode
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Teczer/NativeSongChoicer.git
   cd NativeSongChoicer
   ```
   
2. Delete the App.json files and rebuild with Expo to generate your own files.
   
3. Regenerate the files with expo-cli and start the project with yarn:
   ```sh
   expo init
   yarn install
   yarn start
   ```
